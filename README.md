# Bayesian Data Analysis: Basic Theory

This presentation was realized for the Experimental Linguistic Workshop of the 7th of June 2024 in the LLF. It is about the basic theory of Bayesian Data Analysis.
You will find in this repository two presentations, one that is incremental (Bayesian_Data_Analysis_w_breaks.pdf) that was used to break out the slides during the presentation, and one that is not incremental.
